shsel - runtime shell chooser
=============================

shsel is a small program written to fulfill a very specific goal.
if you need to allow choice between multiple different commands
when a user logs in, without giving them a full shell right away,
shsel will help you. otherwise, it's probably not what you need.

when a user's login shell is set to shsel, they will be greeted
with a list of choices on login:

    available shells:
       0 - bash
       1 - zsh
       2 - dtach
       3 - irssi
    select shell [0]:

and that's all they're given. if a program isn't in the list,
they can't run it, so if they aren't offered an interactive
shell, there's no way for them to get one.
